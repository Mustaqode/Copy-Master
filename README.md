# EasyClipboard
A clipboard app to avoid missing copied contents.

This is a simple android app that listens to the system clipboard and fetches the copied clip every time user copies something
in his/her phone.

I used Kotlin to code the app.

Realm db to save the clips.

Foreground service to listen and save clip in the backgroud.

Livedata to update db realtime. 

--> This app is live on playstore <--

--> This app won't work in Android 10 or above since Google decided to stop users from accessing system clipboard. <--
